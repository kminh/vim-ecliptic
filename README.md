# Ecliptic.vim

##INTRODUCTION

Using the clipboard with vim is one of its biggest painpoints.
This plugin attempts to expose some mappings that make using the clipboard more sane.

It eclipses your regular clipboard functionality, vim's yank and put commands.

The mneumonic *c* prefixes each command (think clipboard).
